# CartPole AI

An AI built using reinforcement learning to solve the traditional cart pole problem.

## Requirements

Libraries: Tflearn, Numpy, Scipy

## Installation

> pip install tflearn


## Usage

Make a folder data which stores saved models. A pre-trained '477 model' is included with the project. To use the model replace the files in data folder with the files in the model file.

## Train

```
python CartPole-v0.py
```

## Using pre-trained model

Pass an arguement **True** to the below functions and run the program. It will start to use the saved model and training data.

1. generate_training_data
2. train

## Test

Use the **test** function to test the game.
